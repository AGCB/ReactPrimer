### Usage

* Name individual components, assign parent-child relationships, and add components to the project tree.

* Drag and drop individual components to restructure the hierarchy tree view.

* Export project to generate a folder of fully connected component classes.

* Save generated components locally to a new or existing project.

### Why

React Primer provides a visual representation of your project during the preliminary stages of development, before you write a single line of code.

This simple to use application saves time by generating component files that automatically require and render their child components based on the prototyped hierarchy.

React Primerâ€™s component tree GUI makes it easy to test, edit, and re-export your component tree as many times as needed.
